# PROBLEM
Consumers over the age of 55 are generally thought to be at the height of their economic power. At the same time this demographic 
is not particularly savvy with social media. This likely means that information about their economic activity is not directly 
available at Foursquare. The aim of this report is to take available data and use machine learning to predict which shops and neighborhoods 
might appeal to older consumers. This data will allow producers of products targeting this market to identify locations for shops, 
advertising, and product placement.

#SAMPLE
The project is a pilot study that begins by analyzing cases in Florida. Data from the US census on median age is used to construct a 
set of 3 cities with an older median age and a set of 3 cities with a young median age. The model resulting from these comparisons
will be used to evaluate neighborhoods in a familar city in Florida. The older cities all have median ages over 45 and are: Boca Raton,
Naples, aNaples, and Sarasota. The younger cities all have median ages below 34 and are: Gainesville, Tallahassee, Orlando

The project will use data from the US census as queried through google to identify cities that have high median ages
The aim of this project is to identify businesses and neighborhoods that appeal 
to older consumers. This information can be used to open a shop that targets this market, drive decisions about on site advertising, or 
product placement.

The business problem is to identify whether a neighbohood attracts older shoppers. Consumers over 55 are generally thought 
of as not being social media savvy. At the same time they have disposible income and are at the height of their economic power. 
The aim of this project is to use demographics to try to uncover businesses that hold appeal to over 55 shoppers. 

It is generally thought that 
people over 55 are not social media savvy. The aim of this project is to be a pilot study and to use demographics to infer whether
a particular neighborhood
