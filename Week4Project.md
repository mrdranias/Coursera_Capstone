# PROBLEM
Consumers over the age of 55 are generally thought to be at the height of their economic power. At the same time this demographic 
is not particularly savvy with social media. This likely means that information about their economic activity is not directly 
available at Foursquare. The aim of this report is to take available data and use machine learning to predict which shops and neighborhoods 
might appeal to older consumers. This data will allow producers of products targeting this market to identify locations for shops, 
advertising, and product placement.

# SAMPLE
This pilot study analyzes data from at most 6 cities in Florida. Cities were selected using median age data from the US census. 
Three cities represent older cities with a median age higher than 45 (Boca Raton, Naples, Homosassa Springs,mean=56) and 
three cities represent younger cities with a median age below 35 (Kissimmee, Gainesville, Tallahassee, mean=28). 
Citywide data on foursquare will be probed and the frequency of different classes of businesses will be computed for each city. 
This information will be used to classify neighborhoods (15 zip codes) in Metro Orlando Florida. Ground truth is census data 
for age and personal observation as a native of Orlando.
